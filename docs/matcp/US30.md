# User Story 30 – Best-Fitting Curve and Complexity Analysis

## 📘 Introduction

Understanding how an algorithm's **execution time grows with input size** is essential for analyzing its **computational complexity**. In this user story, we perform a **curve-fitting analysis** on a set of empirical timing data collected during performance tests of a given algorithm.

The goal is to fit different types of mathematical curves to the data, including:
- **Linear function**: \( f(n) = an + b \)
- **Quadratic function**: \( f(n) = an^2 + bn + c \)
- **Cubic function**: \( f(n) = an^3 + bn^2 + cn + d \)

We then determine which curve best represents the behavior of the observed data, which should ideally align with the **theoretical complexity** of the algorithm.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Read input size and execution time data** from a CSV or XLSX file.
2. **Preprocess the data**, converting string decimals to floats where needed.
3. **Fit three types of polynomial models** to the data (degree 1, 2, and 3).
4. **Visualize the original data and the fitted curves** on a single plot.
5. **Compute error metrics** (such as R² score or visual deviation) to compare model quality.
6. **Interpret the best-fitting curve** in terms of algorithmic complexity.

## 🧮 Mathematical Foundation

### Polynomial Regression

Given a set of points \( (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n) \), we want to find a polynomial of degree \( d \):

\[$
f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \dots + a_dx^d
\$]

We use the **least squares method** to minimize the residuals between the observed times and the fitted curve.

---

### 1. Linear Fit (Degree 1)

\[$
f(x) = a_1x + a_0
\$]

This corresponds to an algorithm with **O(n)** complexity.

---

### 2. Quadratic Fit (Degree 2)

\[$
f(x) = a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0
\$]

This corresponds to an algorithm with **O(n^2)** complexity.

---

### 3. Cubic Fit (Degree 3)

\[$
f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0
\$]

This corresponds to an algorithm with **O(n^3)** complexity.

## 📈 Visualization

We plot:
- The original data points as a **scatter plot**.
- The linear, quadratic, and cubic curves as smooth lines.
- A **legend** identifying each curve.

This graphical representation helps visually determine which curve aligns best with the empirical data.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria (AC01)

- The fitted curve should **align with the reference function** obtained from the **theoretical analysis** of the algorithm's time complexity.
- The result should clearly indicate whether the algorithm behaves **linearly**, **quadratically**, or **cubically**, based on the best-fitting curve.

---

## 🧠 Interpretation

After analyzing the curves:
- We identify the one with the **lowest error** or **best visual fit**.
- We compare this with the **expected theoretical complexity**.
- Any large deviation may indicate issues with the data, algorithm, or measurement method.

This process ensures that the observed execution behavior is **consistent with theoretical expectations**, providing a solid foundation for performance evaluation and future optimization.
